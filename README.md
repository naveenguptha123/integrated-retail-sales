# Integrated Retail Sales Performance Tracking and Analysis

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and tracking retail sales performance using data analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence tools. The main goal is to help businesses understand their sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance, and to make data-driven decisions.

This project was developed as part of a TCS academic project.

#  Objectives
- Analyze sales data across different product categories
- Understand customer purchasing behavior
- Identify high-performing and low-performing products
- Forecast future sales trends
- Visualize key performance indicators using Power BI

---

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains retail transaction records with the following fields:

- TransactionID  
- Date  
- CustomerID  
- Gender  
- Age  
- ProductCategory  
- Quantity  
- PricePerUnit  
- TotalAmount  

The data is cleaned and preprocessed before analysis.

#  Data Preprocessing
The following steps were applied to the dataset:

- Removed missing and duplicate values  
- Standardized date and numeric formats  
- Created derived columns such as TotalSales  
- Converted Age into Age Groups  
- Extracted time features such as Month and Day  

---

## Data Analysis
The analysis includes:

- Monthly and yearly sales trends  
- Product category-wise sales  
- Customer demographics analysis (Age, Gender)  
- Revenue contribution by different customer segments  

---

# Machine Learning Models
The following machine learning techniques are used:

# Sales Prediction
- Random Forest Regression  
- Linear Regression  

These models predict future sales based on historical data.

# Customer Segmentation
- K-Means Clustering  

Customers are grouped into High, Medium, and Low value segments based on their purchasing behavior.

 Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard is created to visualize:

- Total Sales  
- Sales by Product Category  
- Monthly Sales Trends  
- Sales by Gender and Age Group  
- Top performing products  

The dashboard allows filtering by date, category, and customer demographics.

---

# Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- Power BI  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- GitHub  

---

# How to Use
1. Download the dataset and Python files from this repository  
2. Run the Python notebook to clean data and build models  
3. Open the Power BI file (.pbix) to view the dashboard  
4. Analyze sales performance and predictions
